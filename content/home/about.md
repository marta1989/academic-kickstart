# About me

I am a doctoral student in History at the University of Warsaw working under the supervision of [Prof. Robert Wiśniewski](https://uw.academia.edu/RobertWisniewski) and [Dr. Stanisław Adamiak](https://uw.academia.edu/StanislawAdamiak). In my dissertation titled "Conversions between the Nicene and Homoian Christianity in the Germanic Successor Kingdoms between the Fifth and the Seventh Century," I explore the problems of interconfessional relations, religious conversion and its various forms, tolerance and persecution in the late antique and early medieval Western societies. I also work as a doctoral researcher in the project [Presbyters in the Late Antique West](http://www.presbytersproject.ihuw.pl/) run by Prof. Wiśniewski at the Institute of History and collaborate with the Oxford-based project [Cult of Saints in Late Antiquity](http://csla.history.ox.ac.uk/).
